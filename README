To run the script of the demo web page saucedemo, execute the following

## Naming Conventions

- Use `lowerCameCase` for variables, properties, object files and folder names.
- Use `kebab-case` for test file name.
- Use prefix like `is`, `are`, `has` for bool variables.
- Use self explanatory names for variables, E.g `let username`.
- Always start a function with a verb and the entity being affected by it, E.g `async checkObjectText`.
